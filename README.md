# MyDummyNeuNet:

The task asked to the NN is to command the acceleration of a point in order to follow another point (the cost is the integral of the distance in dt).
The "hunted"point should move random. For now I'll train the NN with a Lissajous trajectory.

State: work in progress
at the moment I'm working on gradient descent.
